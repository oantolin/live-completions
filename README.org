* Overview 

This packages provides a minibuffer completion UI.  It pops up the
traditional =*Completions*= buffer and keeps it updated as you type in
the minibuffer.  Besides the traditional multicolumn view of the
completions, this package offers a single column view ---in case the
changing number of columns of the traditional view proves too
dizzying.

* Why write a new completion UI?

There are many excellent minibuffer completion UIs for Emacs: the
built-in packages Icomplete, and Ido; and external packages such as
Ivy, Helm and Selectrum.  What distinguishes this one?

- Like Helm, but unlike Icomplete, Ido, Ivy and Selectrum, this
  package puts the completions are put in a buffer.  Buffers are
  great!  You can easily navigate around them, copy text from them,
  save their contents in a file, etc.  All of that is sometimes
  desirable for completions and is awkward to do when the completions
  reside in the minibuffer.

- It has both the traditional compact view of completions, in several
  columns, and a single column view, with an easy toggle between
  them. Helm, Ivy and Selectrum only present single column views;
  Icomplete and Ido are horizontal by default, but can be configured
  to give single-column vertical views (see icomplete-vertical and
  ido-vertical).

I'd say those are arguably pros. Now some things which are arguably
cons:

- It is very modest in scope: like Icomplete it is /only/ a minibuffer
  completion UI, and it relies on Emacs' completion styles to supply
  the actual completions. In fact, it's pretty much the same as
  cosntantly hitting the =?= key to pop up the =*Completions*= buffer.

  Selectrum is almost as modest in scope: it also mostly focuses on
  selecting items from lists but instead of using the standard
  completion machinery, it has it's own API and a few extra
  convenience commands. Ivy and Helm of course have tons of extra
  functionality beyond selecting items from lists. Ido is a weird mix:
  it doesn't take over all completion (well, not by default, see
  ido-completing-read+), but offers some extra functionality where it
  does take over completion.

- It isn't very pretty. It just looks like the =*Completions*= buffer,
  you've seen it before. The traditional multicolumn view sometimes
  even gets misaligned! This package does however highlight the
  completion that would be entered into the minibuffer by
  =minibuffer-force-complete=, so at least that's a small splash of
  color.

* Defining you own single column commands

If you don't want to use =live-completions-mode= all the time, or you
use it in multiple column mode, but you want to define a few commands
that provide single-column live completion, use the
=live-completions-single-column-do= macro.  Use this for lists with
naturally long candidates, such as filesystem paths or kill-ring
entries.

For example, let's implement a command to yank from the kill-ring
using completion. Often the kills are multiline, so for improved
usability we'll need (1) the completion to start in single column
mode, (2) the number of lines used to display entries to be relatively
large, and (3) the separator to be, say, a red dotted line:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun insert-kill-ring-item ()
    "Insert item from kill-ring, selected with completion."
    (interactive)
    (live-completions-single-column-do
        (:separator (propertize "\n··········\n" 'face '(:foreground "red"))
         :height 30)
      (insert (completing-read "Yank: " kill-ring nil t))))
#+end_src

Note that the completion merely /starts out/ in single column mode:
nothing keeps you from toggling between single and multiple columns
while =insert-kill-ring-item= is active. Once the command finishes
running, your previous column completion configuration will be
restored.

Both the =:separator= and =:height= are optional. The =:separator= defaults
to =live-completions-horizontal-separator=. If you don't include a
=:height= the default is to follow =temp-buffer-resize-mode= if you have
it active and to use =fit-window-to-buffer=, otherwise (this lets the
completions buffer take up most of the frame). If you omit both parts
you still need to include the empty parenthesis:
=(live-completions-single-column-do () ...)=!.

This package contains the =live-completions-single-column-do= macro for
you to implement your own commands. It does not define any commands
that use the macro.
