This packages provides a minibuffer completion UI.  It pops up the
traditional =*Completions*= buffer and keeps it updated as you type in
the minibuffer.  Besides the traditional multicolumn view of the
completions, this package offers a single column view ---in case the
changing number of columns of the traditional view proves too
dizzying.

* Why write a new completion UI?

There are many excellent minibuffer completion UIs for Emacs: the
built-in packages Icomplete, and Ido; and external packages such as
[[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]], [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] and [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][Selectrum]].  What distinguishes this one?

- This package puts the completions in a buffer. This is like Helm,
  but unlike Icomplete, Ido, Ivy and Selectrum. (While Ivy doesn't use
  a buffer by default, it has the =ivy-occur= command which produces a
  neat buffer.) Buffers are great! You can easily navigate around
  them, copy text from them, save their contents in a file, etc. All
  of that is sometimes desirable for completions and is awkward to do
  when the completions reside in the minibuffer.

  If you want to define your own actions for the candidate at point in
  the =*Completions*= buffer, Emacs already has a convenient
  =completion-list-mode-map= keymap where you can bind them.

- It has both the traditional compact view of completions, in several
  columns, and a single column view, with an easy toggle between
  them. Helm, Ivy and Selectrum only present single column views;
  Icomplete and Ido are horizontal by default, but can be configured
  to give single-column vertical views (see [[https://github.com/oantolin/icomplete-vertical][icomplete-vertical]] and
  [[https://github.com/creichert/ido-vertical-mode.el][ido-vertical]]).

I'd say those are arguably pros. Now some things which are arguably
cons:

- It is very modest in scope: like Icomplete it is /only/ a minibuffer
  completion UI, and it relies on Emacs' completion styles to supply
  the actual completions. In fact, it's pretty much the same as
  cosntantly hitting the =?= key to pop up the =*Completions*= buffer.

  Selectrum is almost as modest in scope: it also mostly focuses on
  selecting items from lists but instead of using the standard
  completion machinery, it has it's own API and a few extra
  convenience commands. Ivy and Helm of course have tons of extra
  functionality beyond selecting items from lists. Ido is a weird mix:
  it doesn't take over all completion (well, not by default, see
  [[https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/ido-completing-read-plus][ido-completing-read+]]), but offers some extra functionality where it
  does take over completion.

- It isn't very pretty. It just looks like the =*Completions*= buffer,
  you've seen it before. The traditional multicolumn view sometimes
  even gets misaligned! This package does however highlight the
  completion that would be entered into the minibuffer by
  =minibuffer-force-complete=, so at least that's a small splash of
  color.

  (Did you spot the misalignment? :P)

* Sort orders for candidates

  The variable =live-completions-sort-order= controls the sorting of
  completion candidates. You can customize this variable. It can take
  three values:

  - =display=: this is the order of the classic =*Completions*= buffer, it
    is the default.
  - =cycle=: this is the order that tab cycling in the default
    minibuffer tab completion uses, and is also the order Icomplete uses.
  - =nil=: no sorting, even if the completion source specifies a sort
    function.

  The =cycle= and =nil= options put the candidate that force completion
  would select at the top of the list. The classic =display= oder does
  not, but it should be easy to spot this candidate because is is
  higlighted.

* Defining your own commands with live completion

If you don't want to use =live-completions-mode= all the time but you
want to define a few commands that provide live completion, use the
=live-completions-do= macro.  You can ask it to start in signle-column
mode, which is useful for lists with naturally long candidates, such
as filesystem paths or kill-ring entries.

For example, let's implement a command to yank from the kill-ring
using completion. Often the kills are multiline, so for improved
usability we'll need (1) the completion to start in single column
mode, (2) the number of lines used to display entries to be relatively
large, and (3) the separator to be, say, a red dotted line:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun insert-kill-ring-item ()
    "Insert item from kill-ring, selected with completion."
    (interactive)
    (live-completions-do
        (:columns 'single
         :separator (propertize "\n··········\n" 'face '(:foreground "red"))
         :height 30)
      (insert (completing-read "Yank: " kill-ring nil t))))
#+end_src

Note that the completion merely /starts out/ in single column mode:
nothing keeps you from toggling between single and multiple columns
while =insert-kill-ring-item= is active. Once the command finishes
running, your previous column completion configuration will be
restored.

All of the options, =:columns=, =:separator= and =:height=, are
optional. The =:separator= is only used in single-column mode and
defaults to =live-completions-horizontal-separator=. If you don't
include a =:height= the default is to follow =temp-buffer-resize-mode= if
you have it active and to use =fit-window-to-buffer= otherwise (this
lets the completions buffer take up most of the frame). If you omit
all three parts you still need to include the empty parenthesis:
=(live-completions-do () ...)=!.

This package contains the =live-completions-do= macro for you to
implement your own commands. It does not define any commands that use
the macro.
