* Overview 

This packages provides a minibuffer completion UI.  It pops up the
traditional =*Completions*= buffer and keeps it updated as you type in
the minibuffer.  Besides the traditional multicolumn view of the
completions, this package offers a single column view ---in case the
changing number of columns of the traditional view proves too
dizzying.

* Why write a new completion UI?

There are many excellent minibuffer completion UIs for Emacs: the
built-in packages Icomplete, and Ido; and external packages such as
Ivy, Helm and Selectrum.  What distinguishes this one?

- Like Helm, but unlike Icomplete, Ido, Ivy and Selectrum, this
  package puts the completions are put in a buffer.  Buffers are
  great!  You can easily navigate around them, copy text from them,
  save their contents in a file, etc.  All of that is sometimes
  desirable for completions and is awkward to do when the completions
  reside in the minibuffer.

- It has both the traditional compact view of completions, in several
  columns, and a single column view, with an easy toggle between
  them. Helm, Ivy and Selectrum only present single column views;
  Icomplete and Ido are horizontal by default, but can be configured
  to give single-column vertical views (see icomplete-vertical and
  ido-vertical).

I'd say those are arguably pros. Now some things which are arguably
cons:

- It is very modest in scope: like Icomplete it is /only/ a minibuffer
  completion UI, and it relies on Emacs' completion styles to supply
  the actual completions. In fact, it's pretty much the same as
  cosntantly hitting the =?= key to pop up the =*Completions*= buffer.

  Selectrum is almost as modest in scope: it also mostly focuses on
  selecting items from lists but instead of using the standard
  completion machinery, it has it's own API and a few extra
  convenience commands. Ivy and Helm of course have tons of extra
  functionality beyond selecting items from lists. Ido is a weird mix:
  it doesn't take over all completion (well, not by default, see
  ido-completing-read+), but offers some extra functionality where it
  does take over completion.

- It isn't very pretty. It just looks like the =*Completions*= buffer,
  you've seen it before. The traditional multicolumn view sometimes
  even gets misaligned! This package does however highlight the
  completion that would be entered into the minibuffer by
  =minibuffer-force-complete=, so at least that's a small splash of
  color.
